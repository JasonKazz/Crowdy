# Crowdy
Interactive evacuation planning from furnished floor plans, with editable layouts, scenario-based occupancy, crowd simulation, and before-and-after comparisons. Built at Cal Hacks 13.0.

Empty directories contain `.gitkeep` placeholders. This scaffold does not add any frontend files or application implementation.

## Local configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the repository root and update it locally. `.env` files, credentials, uploads, local databases, and generated results are ignored by Git. Commit only placeholder values in `.env.example`.

The environment variables are proposed configuration for the backend; configuration loading is not implemented yet. Data paths are relative to `backend/`. The future backend must explicitly load the root `.env` or receive these values through its deployment environment.

## Local simulation

From `backend/`, with its Python 3.12 environment activated:

```bash
python -m app.simulation.run_example ../examples/two_exit_room.json
python -m app.simulation.animate data/two_exit_room_result.json
open data/two_exit_room_animation.html
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The original `simple_room.json` and commands without arguments still work. Results and HTML are written to the ignored `backend/data/` directory, with names based on the input file.

A scenario supplies either explicit `occupants` or `population` settings. The latter contains `count`, `seed`, and `spawn_area_ids` referencing walkable-area IDs. Placement is uniform within the selected connected area, excluding furniture and exit zones, with clearance between bodies and boundaries. It does not infer activities or seating. The saved result includes the resolved starting positions and the generation settings.

Agents choose an exit once, by shortest routed distance to an interior target point in each exit zone. This accounts for obstacles but does not optimize for congestion or dynamically change destinations. The result records initial `assignments`, departure `evacuations`, and `summary.per_exit_counts`. `clearance_time` is null if anyone remains at the time limit.

The example uses meters, with x increasing right and y increasing up. The current geometry validator requires one connected walkable polygon; population placement also requires one connected spawn polygon.
